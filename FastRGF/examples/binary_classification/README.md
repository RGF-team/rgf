# Binary Classification Example

Here is an example for FastRGF to run binary classification task.
Dataset for this example is taken from [here](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#madelon) and features are written in libsvm sparse format.

You should make sure that executable files are placed into `../../bin` folder.

Execute the shell script in this folder to run the example:

for Windows:

```
run.sh
```

for Unix-like systems:

```
bash run.sh
```
