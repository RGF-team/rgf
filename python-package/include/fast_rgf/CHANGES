0.2 (Aug 2016)
  This is the first release. It only supports binary classification and regression, with significant simplifications from the original RGF algorithm for speed consideration. Additional functionalities  will be supported in future releases.
  
0.3 (Dec 2016)
  Fixed several bugs that affect prediction performance (especially for small datasets).
  
0.4 (Aug 2017)
  Fixed bug which truncated negative float values to numeric_limits<float>::min(),  causing degration in prediction performance for datasets with negative values; changed truncation to numeric_limits<float>::lowest()

0.5 (Sept 2017)
  Added openmp support and multi-threading for discretization
  Added loop unrolling and compilation option for simd optimization
